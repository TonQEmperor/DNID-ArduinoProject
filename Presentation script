1. Opening
   B/S: Good morning everyone!

2. Introduction (group member)
   B: I came up with the idea, including what story, what scene, and the overall structure of the project. I decided which moment to use, which is big wolf eats little red cap, and huntsman breaks into the house to save the day right after. I also did the written parts of this project, explaining what we have done and what goal we have achieved. 
   S: I was basically the engineer of this project. I did the coding and wiring to allow all the motors to do what we wanted them to do, such as door opening, wolf’s jaw and arm movement, and curtain. I prepared the materials we needed such as 3D printed chair and table, card boards, hot glue guns, chopsticks, and papers to build the project. Lastly, I invited Bruce to my house and built the project together.
   
3. Intro (story)
   B: We picked the tale from the book names “The Classic Fairy Tales”, edited by Maria Tatar. It is a fairy tale collection. The Little Red Cap we chose is Brothers Grimm’s edition. The entire story about Brothers Grimm’s little red cap is grandma and little red cap got eaten by the big wolf in grandma’s house. The big wolf goes to sleep, and the huntsman comes in, saving them both by cutting wolf’s belly open. 
   S: The reason we chose this story is because Little Red Cap is well known, and there is such a good ending which creates a great book-flip moment. Additionally, if we placed the chair in the door way, it could get flipped off, which is a cool addition to our project, even though this detail is not mentioned in the original story.
