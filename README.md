Hello there! 
Welcome to the repository of our Arduino project. Here contains nearly all files that we created and used during the project.

- Notes: both the repository and the project page were not created during the making of our project but at the end. Therefore the upload timeline here wasn't synced with the actual time. Instead, we uploaded these files for a recap of our progress. Please beware of that. Also, the files here are used for only educational purposes. Please DO NOT reuse them in any other way. Thank you for your understanding and we hope you enjoy our creation!
